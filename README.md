# Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post

## Overview
This is an analysis of the 2020 Stackoverflow developer survey. The survey includes about 60+K developers from 184 countries. My main motivation for this mini-project is to build a profile of a typical developer; more especifically I'll see how big a role _formal education_ plays in developers' career. 

Furthermore, I'll see into the factors that could make the job of a developer attractive, or less attractive. Most importantly, I'll investigate what programming languages and technologies less experienced developers or individuals interested in breaking into the field should focus on. I'll concolude the analysis by giving two pro-tips. 


## Libraries
- pandas
